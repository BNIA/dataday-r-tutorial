		p
			| A vector is an indexed set of values which all have the same mode (type). This is also known as an array, or a list in other languages. There are 5 basic modes of vectors: numeric, complex, logical, character and raw. The vector is the most primitive type in R. That is, the most basic elements in R are all vectors.

		+rcode
			| a <- 4
			| length(a)
		+rcode
			| [1] 1
		p This shows us that a has a length. Additionally:
		+rcode
			| a[1]
		+rcode
			| [1] 4
		p We can index a, just as we would an array in Java, or a list or tuple in python.
